# Requirements

* Vim (obviously). Neovim also works.
* clangd for C/C++ autocomplete
* python-language-server for Python autocomplete

# Installation
Simply run `bootstrap.sh`.
You can get it directly from Github by running the following command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoinealb/dotvim/master/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

If you want Python omnicompletion you should also install the `jedi` package in the virtualenv you are working in.
